BEGIN CREMAP - remap character bitmaps
               (block declaration)

Grammar:
 "BEGIN CREMAP" [ mode [ "," st_c ] ]
    .
    . 0-or-more "DATA" or "HDATA" lines
    .
 "END"

Description:
 - mode: <uint8> 0 = 8x8 pixel (default)
                 1 = 16x16 pixel
 - st_c: <uint16> 0 \029 65535 character
   code remap starting point (default 0)
 - DATA lines must consist of 1-or-more
   <uint8> values or <array<uint8>>
   values that are flattened in-place
   to provide bitmaps, formatted
   according to mode, that will redefine
   on-screen characters starting with
   character code st_c
