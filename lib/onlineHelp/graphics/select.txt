SELECT - activate and target one-or-more
Playfields for graphics operations

Grammar:
 "SELECT" target

Arguments:
 - target: <record|number|array<record>>
   a Playfield record, playfield record
   ID number, or an Array of one-or-more
   Playfield records to be SELECT'd

Notes:
 - Graphics keywords will draw to
   whatever the currently SELECT'd
   Playfields are
 - In the Display record, the sel field
   indicates which Playfields are
   currently SELECT'd. Whenever sel
   changes, the scrollback buffer is
   cleared. See the 'scrollback buffer'
   section of the %shell% help topic
 - Some keywords have arguments that
   allow the current SELECT'ions to be
   temporarily overridden
 - There are 8 Playfields, and each is
   'attached' to the Display when they
   are first SELECT'ed
 - Every attached Playfield uses many
   system resources. At VCE power-on,
   only Playfield 0 is attached to the
   Display
 - The only way to detach Playfields
   from the Display is by doing a full
   CLEAR or RESET

Synonyms:
 - "SELC"
