Your VCE has a color graphics system.
Graphics are anything visible on the
computer screen. The main features of
the VCE graphics system are -

 - Color depth: the VCE's display is
   made of a 2D grid of colored dots
   called pixels. Each pixel can have
   one of 256 colors with limitations
 - Playfields: the VCE's display is
   powered by the new PRP-99\u2122 virtual
   chipset. It consists of 8 stacked
   planes of pixels, each rendered using
   a 2D grid of graphical characters
 - Characters: each character on a
   playfield is displayed with a
   foreground color, a background
   color, and one of 65536 possible
   Kid-SCII character codes. Each
   character code gets its own bitmap
 - Character bitmaps: 1-bit pixel data
   tied to each character code. When a
   character map changes, all characters
   on all playfields displaying that
   bitmap's character code will redraw
 - Turtle graphics: vector-based render
   plane using a BeamVectra 1000\u2122 CRT
   virtual deflection system. The turtle
   graphics plane is sandwiched between
   the fourth and fifth character
   graphics playfields enabling novel
   hybrid raster/vector user experiences
