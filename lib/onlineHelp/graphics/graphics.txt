Your VCE has a color graphics system.
Graphics are anything you can see on the
computer screen. The main features of
the VCE graphics system are -

 - Color depth: the VCE's display is
   made of a grid of colored dots called
   pixels. Each pixel can have one of
   256 colors, with some limitations
 - Playfields: the VCE's display
   consists of 8 independent, stacked
   pixel planes organized as a 40x30
   grid of character graphics powered by
   our all-new PRP-99\u2122 chipset
 - Characters: displayed with a
   foreground color and a background
   color and with one of 65536 possible
   character codes
 - Character maps: the 1-bit pixel data
   tied to a character code. When a
   character map changes, all characters
   on all playfields displaying that map
   will be redrawn
 - Turtle graphics: vector-based render
   plane using a BeamVectra 1000\u2122 CRT
   deflection package. The turtle
   graphics plane is sandwiched
   in-between the fourth and fifth
   character graphics playfields to
   enable novel hybrid raster-vector
   user experiences
