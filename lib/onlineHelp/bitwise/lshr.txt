LSHR - Logical shift bits right

Grammar:
 "LSHR" value "," offset

Arguments:
 - value: <number> value to shift right
 - offset: <number> count of bits to
   shift right by, must be GTE 0

Evaluates to:
 <int32> value shifted right by offset
 bits

Notes:
 - offset number of 0 bits will shifted
   in from the left of value regardless
   of what value's sign bit was

   This behavior differs from the "sign
   propagating" SHR keyword as a logical
   shift left of a negative value will
   evaluate to a positive int32 whenever
   offset is GT 0
