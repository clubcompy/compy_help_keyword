ROL - Rotate low byte (8 bits) left

Grammar:
 "ROL" value "," offset

Arguments:
 - value: <number> value to rotate left
 - offset: <number> count of bits to
   rotate left by

Evaluates to:
 <int32> value with low 8 bits rotated
 left by offset bits. The high 24 bits
 should be the same as value's.

Notes:
 - As bits rotate off the left edge
   of the low byte, they rotate onto its
   left edge
