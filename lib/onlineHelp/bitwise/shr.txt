SHR - Shift bits right, propagating the
sign bit

Grammar:
 "SHR" value "," offset

Arguments:
 - value: <number> value to shift right
 - offset: <number> count of bits to
   shift right by, must be GTE 0

Evaluates to:
 <int32> value shifted right by offset
 bits

Notes:
 - If value's sign bit was 1, offset
   number of 1 bits will shifted in from
   the left of value
 - If value's sign bit was 0, offset
   number of 0 bits will shifted in from
   the left of value
