LISTEN - react to signalled records

Grammar:
 "LISTEN" rec
    .
    . 0-or-more comfy statements/lines
    .
 "END"

Arguments:
 - rec: <record> a record to listen to

Evaluates to:
 <listener_key> identifies the listener

Notes:
 - LISTEN'ers to records will have their
   code blocks run on each SIGNAL to rec
 - VCE will clone rec at the time it is
   SIGNAL'led. Inside the LISTEN block,
   this clone of rec appears as a
   snapshot from the past that may
   differ from the current time's rec
 - All records in the Comfy language can
   be SIGNAL'led and LISTEN'ed
  \156 Only the VCE system may SIGNAL
    built-in records (e.g. Cursor)
  \156 Only the user's Comfy code may
    SIGNAL user-created records
 - Pass the listener_key to CANCEL to
   stop the LISTEN block from being
   triggered by SIGNAL's
