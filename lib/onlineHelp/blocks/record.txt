 "END"

Arguments:
 - sym: <symbol> designating the global
   name of the record_def

Notes:
 - A record is a fixed set of named data
   values called fields. Records are
   convenient for grouping related data
 - A record_def is a set of field names
   with default values declared on the
   field assignment lines
 - Record_def's are used as templates
   for the creation of new records
 - The assignment operator is used to
   create a new record from a record_def
 - When assigning record_def sym to a
   variable, the VCE will create a new
   record instance and set all of its
   fields to the defaults sym's field
   assignment lines. See the assign
   topic for more information
 - Records can notify the Comfy program
   about events happening in the
   computer. See the LISTEN, SIGNAL and
   CANCEL topics for more information
 - Built-in records supplied by the VCE
   can notify the Comfy program about
   events happening on VCE-managed
   systems. See the builtins topic for
   more information
