Comfy statements are usually a single
line of text, with keywords or operators
telling the VCE how to interpret the
line

Some Comfy statements are complex enough
to benefit from being split across
multiple program lines. Statements
spanning multiple lines where keywords
and operators are grouped together are
known as a 'block'

These are some of the Comfy language
keywords that help with managing blocks:

  %BEGIN%    %END%      %DATA%     %HDATA%
  %DECLARE%  %RECORD%   %LISTEN%   %CANCEL%
