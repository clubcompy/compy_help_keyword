[] (subscript) - item at index

Grammar:
 arr "[" index "]"

Arguments:
 - arr: <array>
 - index: <number|boolean> item index in
   arr GTE 0. See notes for allowed
   limits

Evaluates to:
 <*> item in arr at index

Notes:
 - If index is a boolean, it will be
   converted to a number before the
   subscript. true will be 1. false will
   be 0
 - Array indexes are "zero-based", which
   means they begin counting items from
   the number 0. If you want to access
   the first item in an array use index
   0, second item use index 1, and so on
 - When an array subscript is the last
   expression on the left side of a
   variable assignment (=), index may be
   LTE LENGTH arr. Assignment to an
   array at LENGTH arr appends a new
   value to the end of arr
   similar to INSERT's append behavior
 - When the array subscript is not used
   as the last expression on the left
   side of a variable assignment (=),
   index may be LT LENGTH arr
