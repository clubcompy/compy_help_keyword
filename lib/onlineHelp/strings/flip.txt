FLIP - Change the case of characters in
a string

Grammar:
 "FLIP" value [ "," toupper ]

Arguments:
 - value: <string> string to flip
 - toupper: <boolean> should value
   be forced all upper- or lowercase?

Evaluates to:
 <string> with Kid-SCII characters a-z
 swapped with corresponding A-Z
 characters

Notes:
 - When toupper is truthy, evaluated
   value is made all uppercase
 - When toupper is falsy, evaluated
   value is made all lowercase
 - When toupper is omitted and value is
   - all lowercase: evaluated value is
     made all uppercase
   - all uppercase: evaluated value is
     made all lowercase
   - a mix of lowercase and uppercase:
     evaluated value is made all
     uppercase
 - Kid-SCII characters other than a-z
   and A-Z are not evaluated by FLIP and
   will be copied unchanged to the
   evaluated string
