SPLIT - break a string into an array of
string tokens wherever individual
characters in a delimiter string match

Grammar:
 "SPLIT" value [ "," delim [ "," tok ] ]

Arguments:
 - value: <string|*> value to be
   stringified before split
 - delim: <string> delimiter characters
   to split value by (default empty
   string '')
 - tok: <boolean> should delim tokens
   encountered be included in the
   evaluated array? (default false)

Evaluates to:
 <array<string>> array of string tokens
 split out of the stringified value by
 matching a character in delim. If tok
 is true, any character in delim that
 matches will be included as tokens
 where splits occur
