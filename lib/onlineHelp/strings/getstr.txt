GETSTR - Read a string from the
keyboard

Grammar:
 "GETSTR" [ maxc | ( rec "," maxc ) ]

Arguments:
 - rec: <record> can read characters
   starting from its current position.
   defaults to Cursor record
 - maxc: <number> maximum number of
   characters allowed in evaluated
   string, GTE 0. default 0

Evaluates to:
 <string> Kid-SCII characters read from
 rec, up to maxc length when maxc GT 0

Notes:
 - When maxc is 0, GETSTR will not place
   any limit on number of characters it
   will read from rec
 - How GETSTR behaves depends on the
   type of rec:
  \156 Cursor (default): reads PRINT-able
    characters typed on the keyboard
    from the Cursor's start position up
    to maxc characters typed and the
    Enter key is pressed
  \156 File: reads up to maxc characters
    from the File's current position or
    the end-of-file, whichever comes
    first
 - The current Comfy running task will
   pause at GETSTR until it completes
   evaluation. Other tasks like LISTEN
   tasks will continue to run
 - GETSTR is only allowed in the main
   Comfy task and not in LISTEN or other
   secondary tasks
