GETSTR - Read a string from the
keyboard

Grammar:
 "GETSTR" [ maxc | ( rec "," maxc ) ]

Arguments:
 - maxc: <number> maximum number of
   characters allowed in evaluated
   string (default 0, no maximum)
 - rec: <record> can read characters
   starting from its current position
   (default Cursor record)

Evaluates to:
 <string> Kid-SCII characters read
 from rec, up to maxc length when maxc
 GT 0

Notes:
 - How GETSTR behaves depends on the
   type of rec:
   - Cursor (default): will read
     PRINT-able characters typed on the
     keyboard from the Cursor's start
     position up to maxc characters
     typed and the Enter key is pressed
   - File: will read up to maxc
     characters from the File's current
     position or the end-of-file,
     whichever comes first
 - The current Comfy running task will
   pause at GETSTR until it completes
   evaluation. Other tasks like LISTEN
   tasks will continue to run
 - GETSTR is only allowed in the main
   Comfy task and not in LISTEN or other
   secondary tasks
