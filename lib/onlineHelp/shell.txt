               VCE Shell
               \u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E
The VCE shell is a text editor that lets
you type-in programs. This topic talks
about how to enter in programs and use
the shell's special key combos to
manipulate the Cursor and how it moves
around the Display

Cursor
\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E
The flashing block on your VCE Display
is called the Cursor. When you press
keys on the keyboard, the cursor will
either move, print a symbol, or both

There are keyboard keys and key combos
you can use to control what the Cursor
does:



Prompt
\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E
When the VCE is done doing a job, is not
running a program, and wants to announce
that it is ready to take new type-in
instructions from the user, the shell
will display a 'prompt'. Here is an
example of a shell prompt:

\uEB40\uE9BD
woldie \175 In folder: '0:/woldie' \175

\uEAFE\uE8FE
The prompt shows the logged-in user to
clubcompy.com and what folder on the
Compy File System (FS) they are looking
at

Scrollback Buffer
\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E\u203E
The shell keeps track of lines it has
PRINT'ed to the Display. New lines can
be PRINT'ed one line below the Cursor's
position, and when the Cursor reaches
the bottom of the Display, it will
scroll all lines of the Display up by
one line. This all happens automatically
as part of the way PRINT works

Lines that scroll off the top of the
Display are not lost. They are recorded
into an internal data structure called
the 'scrollback buffer'

By PRINT'ing special Kid-SCII escape
sequences, the Display can be scrolled
up and down to recover saved lines from
the scrollback buffer back onto the
Display

This help program uses the scrollback
buffer in this way to display large
documents which cannot fit onto one
screen

The scrollback buffer stores up to 5000
lines. Once that limit is reached, the
topmost lines will be deleted from the
scrollback buffer until 5000 or fewer
lines are left
