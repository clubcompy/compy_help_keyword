Congratulations! You now are the proud
owner of a ClubCompy Virtual Computer
Environment (VCE).

With your VCE, you will learn to write
computer programs, make and play games,
solve real-world problems, and over
time, understand how computers may be
applied in every facet of your life.

This help program will give you only an
overview of your VCE's capabilities. For
full details, please purchase a copy of
the ClubCompy Programmer's Reference
Guide book when it becomes available.

Okay, let's get started!

First, learn how to control this %HELP%
screen.  Press the down and up arrow
buttons on your keyboard now: \uF105 \uF103

When there is more to read on these help
topics, you can slide the additional
text into view using the arrow buttons
on your keyboard. Other buttons that
work are \uF10B\uF10C and \uF109\uF10A

You have probably noticed by now that
most things in ClubCompy use your
keyboard for controls and not a touch
screen or mouse. Computer keyboarding
is a valuable life skill, and that's
why we've designed your VCE to give you
daily typing practice.

This help program has many topics for
you to read. The names of these topics
are highlighted with a different
color: %\uE500 \uE503%

If a topic word is interesting to you,
type its highlighted letter keys on your
keyboard in the box at the bottom of the
screen and then press the \uF100\uF101\uF102 key to
switch to that topic.

If you want to go back to a topic you
were looking at earlier, press the left
arrow \uF106 button.

You can exit help at any time by
pressing the \uF107\uF108 key on your
keyboard.

Here are some introductory topics you
can jump to now:

 \156 %program% - what is programming?
 \156 %comfy% - 'speak' your VCE's language
 \156 %shell% - type in programs like a pro

Welcome to ClubCompy, and thanks for
being such a great user!
