= (assign) - variable assignment

Grammar:
 lvalue "=" rvalue

Arguments:
 - lvalue: <symbol|record field|
   subscript> variable assignee
 - rvalue: <comfy expression> evaluates
   to a comfy value to be assigned to
   lvalue

Evaluates to:
 <*> evaluated rvalue assigned to lvalue

Side effects:
 - lvalue is dereferenced and rvalue is
   assigned to lvalue according to rules
   described in notes below
 - If lvalue was a symbol that did not
   yet exist, after assignment completes
   the variable will exist for that
   symbol

Notes:
 - Comfy variables can store complex
   values like arrays or records. When
   you assign the same complex value to
   multiple variables, the value is not
   copied. Instead, the variables share
   a 'pointer' to the value, making the
   process faster.
 - Comfy variables can hold simple
   values like numbers, booleans, or
   strings. Simple values are copied
   each time they are assigned to a
   variable. Copying the value is faster
   and more convenient than using
   pointers for simple values.
