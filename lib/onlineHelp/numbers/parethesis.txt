() (parenthesis) - operator precedence

Grammar:
 "(" value ")"

Arguments:
 - value: <comfy expression|*>

Notes:
 Parentheses are used to dictate the
 order operations are performed in
 expressions. Comfy expressions
 enclosed within parentheses are
 evaluated before those outside them
 regardless of the standard operator
 precedence.
