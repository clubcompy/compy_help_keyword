TRUNC - Removes fractional digits

Grammar:
  "TRUNC" num_value

Evaluates to:
  num_value with fractional part removed

Notes:
 - Where FLOOR performs a "round down"
   operation on num_value, TRUNC merely
   returns the whole number part of
   num_value
 - When num_value is positive, FLOOR and
   TRUNC behave the same, but when
   num_value is negative, they produce
   different results
