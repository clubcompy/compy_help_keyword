The Comfy language provides built-in
%variables% that are either records or
arrays of records that are always
available to you and tell you about the
state of VCE subsystems. Here are all of
the built-ins in the Comfy language:

  %Border%   %Clock%    %Cursor%   %Display%
  %Joystick% %Keyboard% %Math%     %Mouse%
  %Turtle%   %Playfield%

  There are a built-ins reserved for future
  use that do not do anything yet. Those
  reserved built-in's are:

  Sprite   Voice    Device   Touch
  Award

Notes:
 - Built-ins are special variables that
   may only be modified by the VCE.
   It is an error to modify built-ins
   using the assignment operator "=".
