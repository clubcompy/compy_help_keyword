VWAIT - wait for next display frame

Grammar:
 "VWAIT"

Notes:
 - Whenever the VCE paints the Display,
   this is called a 'frame'. This
   concept is similar to 'frames' of
   animation in a film or cartoon
 - VWAIT makes a program wait for the
   next frame to complete, allowing the
   program to synchronize with the
   speed of the Display

  ------------------------------------

VWAIT - control automatic waiting for
display frames at end of loops

Grammar:
 "VWAIT" auto

Arguments:
 - auto: <boolean> when true, enable
   automatic waiting for display frames,
   otherwise disable. See notes

Notes:
 - This is an advanced programming topic
 - In order to ensure that Comfy will
   regularly generate Display frames,
   programs will automatically VWAIT
   every time FOR, WHILE or GOTO causes
   the program's current line number to
   go lower
 - Automatic VWAIT'ing is enabled by
   default when a Comfy program starts
 - Automatic VWAIT'ing can be disabled
   with VWAIT false; this gives Comfy
   quite a performance boost, but the
   VCE Display will not paint a frame
   unless the Comfy program does a VWAIT
 - When Automatic VWAIT'ing is disabled,
   be sure to sprinkle VWAIT keywords
   throughout your program or else the
   Comfy Display may appear to freeze
