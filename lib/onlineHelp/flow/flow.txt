Comfy programs are organized as a list
of numbered lines of instructions. When
the RUN keyword is used, the VCE will
perform the numbered lines in order
from lowest number to highest. The
line numbers provide a natural ordering
to the 'flow' of a program's lines

There are many reasons programmers might
want to jump around between lines in
their programs. For example, a program
might have to make a decision about
something. Usually the outcome of that
decision will be to jump to different
lines depending on the decision: 'yes'
goes to one line, 'no' goes to a
different line. There are Comfy keywords
that can be used for decision-making

Or, perhaps a programmer wants to repeat
a set of lines. There are Comfy keywords
for that as well

There are even keywords for waiting
that pause on the current line until
things happen

Comfy offers many strange and useful
options for program flow control. If
you're lucky, you'll get to encounter
and use them all! But, be mindful when
you do flow control; bugs love to sneak
into those parts of your code

The Comfy language has keywords whose
purpose is to provide flow control:

  %RUN%      %QUIT%     %GOTO%     %GOSUB%
  %RETURN%   %IF%       %FOR%      %WHILE%
  %BREAK%    %CONTINUE% %VWAIT%    %WAIT%
  %SIGNAL%
