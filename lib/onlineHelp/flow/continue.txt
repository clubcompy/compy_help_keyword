CONTINUE - unconditional GOTO start of
loop

Grammar:
 "CONTINUE" [ levels ]

Arguments:
 - levels: <number> of nested loops to
   CONTINUE to, must be GTE 1. Default 1

Notes:
 - CONTINUE may only be used inside FOR
   or WHILE loop blocks
 - CONTINUE will GOTO the levels-nth END
   statement that follows that
   corresponds with FOR and WHILE loops
   and then proceed to the start of that
   loop for the next iteration
