SIGNAL - notify LISTEN'ers

Grammar:
 "SIGNAL" rec

Arguments:
 - rec: <record> to notify

Notes:
 - SIGNAL can only be used in a running
   program
 - It is an error to SIGNAL any built-in
   record. Use SIGNAL on records created
   with DECLARE RECORD
 - rec will have its LISTEN'ers notified
   ASAP and not immediately. Any pending
   SIGNAL's against rec will be lost if
   the program ends before the VCE has a
   chance to run rec's LISTEN'ers
