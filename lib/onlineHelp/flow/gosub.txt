GOSUB - unconditional jump to subroutine

Grammar:
 "GOSUB" line

Arguments:

Notes:
 - line is treated as the start of a
   program 'subroutine', which is a
   block of code
 - subroutines finish with a RETURN
   line. RETURN unconditionally jumps
   back to the line GOSUB was on

Aliases:
 - "CALL"
