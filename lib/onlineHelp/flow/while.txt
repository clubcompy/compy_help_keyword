WHILE - conditional loop

Grammar:
 "WHILE" isTrue
    .
    . 0-or-more Comfy lines
    .
 "END"

Arguments:
 - isTrue: <boolean> decides whether
   block of Comfy lines get executed.
   See notes

Notes:
 - Works like a repeating IF
 - When isTrue is truthy, the Comfy
   lines are executed; upon reaching
   the END line, GOTO to the
   WHILE line (a.k.a. 'looping')
 - When isTrue is falsy, GOTO the END
   line and leave the WHILE loop
