WRITE - write into handle

Grammar:
 "WRITE" hd "," ar [ "," lm [ "," st ] ]

Arguments:
 - hd: <record<*Handle>> any handle-
   type record (eg. $FileHandle)
 - ar: <array> array that contains items
   that will be written to handle hd
 - lm: <number> limit of number of items
   to write; must be GTE 1. Default
   LENGTH ar - st
 - st: <number> start index in array ar
   of items to write to handle hd.
   Default 0

Evaluates To:
 <record<$Status>> See record definition
 below

Notes:
 - WRITE's behavior changes depending on
   what type of Handle record hd is:
  \156 $FileRecord
   - writing items moves a file pointer
     which keeps track of where in the
     file will be written to next. Use
     SEEK with hd to move or get the
     current file pointer
   - if file is text, each 'item' in
     array ar must be a string. Each
     string will be written to the file
     followed by a new line character
     (0x0a) that is automatically added
   - if file is binary, each 'item' in
     array ar may be a record, array, or
     other built-in type. Items are
     converted to bytes and stored into
     the file

Record<$Status> definition:
 - Signals when: WRITE completes
