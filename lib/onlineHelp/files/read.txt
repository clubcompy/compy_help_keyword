READ - read from handle

Grammar:
 "READ" hd "," ar [ "," lm [ "," st ] ]

Arguments:
 - hd: <record<*Handle>> any handle-
   type record (eg. $FileHandle)
 - ar: <array> output array that
   receives items that will be read from
   handle hd
 - lm: <number> limit of number of items
   to read; must be GTE 1. Default 1
 - st: <number> start index in output
   array ar where items that were read
   are placed. Default 0

Evaluates To:
 <record<$Status>> See record definition
 below

Notes:
 - READ's behavior changes depending on
   what type of Handle record hd is:
  \156 $FileRecord
   - reading items moves a file pointer
     which keeps track of what part of
     the file will be read from next.
     Use SEEK with hd to move or get the
     current file pointer
   - if file is text, each 'item' that
     READ places in ar will consist of
     a string of 16-bit little-endian
     Kid-SCII characters that ends in a
     new line (0x0a, not included) or
     the end-of-file and has a maximum
     4096 character count
   - if file is binary, each 'item' that
     READ places in ar will be the next
     record, array, or other built-in
     type stored in the file

Record<$Status> definition:
 - Signals when: READ completes

   name   \179 <string> empty, unused
  status  \179 <number> zero indicates no
          \179 items were read (end-of-file
          \179 for $FileHandles.) Positive
          \179 value indicates count of
          \179 items read successfully;
          \179 will be LTE item limit lm.
          \179 Negative value indicates
          \179 error result code (see
          \179 codes)
