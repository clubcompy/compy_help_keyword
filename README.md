It would be great for users to test out the HELP text on true neophytes and young kids.  Is the text
comprehensible to them?  Are they able to become productive with the Compy after reading the HELP text?
Please let us know in issues if your kiddos get stuck or confused and suggest how we can improve.

Bear in mind that the HELP topics are **not** intended to be comprehensive!  We should aim to give
beginners a good start with the system, but fine details and nuance should be provided with a physical
Compy System Programmers guide that we must produce.  Producing an authoritative "deep tome" physical
reference guide for our young users to dive into on occasion is part of our company mission.
